## Introduction

**MDT** is a protocol in the decentralized finance space to help traders create automated trading strategies. MDT stands for [**Master Death Teddy**](https://t.me/mdeathted) (a.k.a. **0xDegenaped#8888**), which is the nickname of the creator and core developer of the protocol.

## What is MDT-CLI?

To begin, CLI stands for [**Command-Line Interface**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface); a computer program in the form of lines of text. **MDT-CLI** is the core utility of the protocol, and it is a premier sniper bot that aims for inclusivity rather than exclusivity.

Many investors are unable to purchase a premier sniper bot fur to the exorbitant prices, and this is the exact reason that makes mdtProtocol stands out from other sniper bot.

## How does it work?

**MDT-CLI** is free to download, and traders pays per transaction rather than an upfront payment. The cost of the transaction changes based on the tier that the trader is in.

Compiled and packed for [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/), which is generally one of the fastest server-side solutions for its fast and powerful Chrome's V8 engine. As such, **MDT-CLI** is supported on all Windows, macOS, and most Linux distribution.

To achieve the fastest performance, **MDT-CLI** also interacts with smart contracts and utilizes [**Web3.js**](https://web3js.readthedocs.io/) to sign and send transaction into the Blockchain directly; this enables us to avoid wallet confirmation and route transactions to the memory-pool in near real time.
